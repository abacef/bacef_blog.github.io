It is probably not why you think.

I have good lights and I actually feel more safe at night with being visible to drivers, actually drivers have less distractions at night anyway. Also I do not fear slipping on wet roads in the dark because of lack of visibility, I usually go slow enough around corners and stick to known roads.

The first issue with riding in the dark is actually pinch flats. I run inner tubes and I have to pump my 25mm tires up to 90+ PSI in order to not get a pinch flat. Even with my front headlight it is still hard to make out potholes in the road and I dont think a better light will fix that. When I do run into these potholes I will not have the luxury of slowing down so if the PSI of my tires drops to any lower than 90, you know what will happen. This has happened countless times. Some of you may yell at me to go tubeless and I will cover this in another article, but long story short, it does not have many benefits for me.

The second issue is being blinded. Especially when it is raining, cars' headlights absolutely blind me such that sometimes I even need to stop to wait for the car to pass to continue on safely. I would rather not have multiple opportunities at voluntarily crashing on dark rides.

So yeah, I will stick to the indoor trainer at night.
