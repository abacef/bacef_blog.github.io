Maxing out your carb intake makes you a better cyclist and reduces fatigue during and after your ride. I always aim for 90g per hour. Gels should not be expensive. Make your own!

Cost: $0.15 per 100 g carbs ($7 per 10lb bag sugar)
Prep time: 30s
Cook time: 2 min

Ingredients:

- 2 cups granulated sugar (400g)

Process:

1. Put the sugar into a pan on the stove
1. Add 1 cup water
1. Stir the mixture a little
1. Turn the burner on high
1. Keep stirring gently with a spoon until the spoon no longer attracts visible granules of sugar (see the pictures below) about 1.5 minutes
1. Leave the gel out to cool or put it in a refrigeratoe
1. Put in some sort of container. I currently use a corn syrup bottle (holds all 400g) and put it in my back pocket
