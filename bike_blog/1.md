It is probably not why you think.

I have good lights and I dont feel more unsafe than I do in the day time with vehicles being able to seeing me, actually drivers have less distractions at night anyway. Also I do not fear slipping on wet roads in the dark because of lack of visibility, I usually go slow enough around corners to be confident in my abilities.

The first issue is pinch flats. I run TPU inner tubes and I have to pump my 25mm tires up to 90+ PSI in order to not get a pinch flat. Even with my front headlight it is still hard to make out potholes in the road and I dont think a better light will fix that. When I do run into these potholes I will be doing so at full speed so if the PSI of my tires drops to any lower than 90, you know what will happen. This has happened countless times. Some of you may yell at me to go tubeless and I will cover this in another article, but long story short, it is a good idea not to in my case.

The second issue is being blinded. Especially when it is raining, cars headlights absolutely blind me such that sometimes I even need to stop to wait for the car to pass to continue on safely. I would rather not have multiple opertunities at voluntarilly crashing per ride.

So yeah, I will stick to the indoor trainer at night.
